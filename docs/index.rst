About
-----

Panhandler is a tool to manage and share PAN-OS configuration sets. A configuration set can be a full device
configuration, or a set of configuration elements. Panhandler allows you to import git repositories that contain
one or more configuration templates. Each template contains a set of configuration elements and variables that can
be customized for each deployment. Variables are presented in an auto-generated web form for an operator to complete.
Once complete, the template is rendered and pushed to a PAN-OS device.
